## Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains customer information and details about their subscription. It includes various features that may influence customer churn, such as contract type, payment method, tenure, and service usage.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Jupyter Notebooks

## Libraries
To run this project, you need to install the following Python libraries:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
```
## Data Loading
Make sure to have the dataset (e.g., Telco-Customer-Churn.csv) in the same folder as your notebook:

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Key steps in EDA included:

Analyzing trends and patterns in customer data
Visualizing distributions of churn rates across different features
Identifying correlations between variables

## Data Preprocessing
Key preprocessing steps included:

1. Handling missing values
2. Encoding categorical variables
3. Scaling numerical features

## Model Building
The project utilized tree-based algorithms, including:

1. Decision Trees
2. Random Forests
3. Boosting Trees

## Model Evaluation
Model performance was evaluated using:

1. Confusion Matrix
2. Precision, Recall, F1-Score

## Results
The model achieved an accuracy of over 85% in predicting customer churn, allowing the identification of at-risk customers effectively.

## Conclusion
The predictive model provides valuable insights for improving customer retention strategies and reducing churn rates in the telecommunications industry.

## Future Work
Consider exploring other algorithms, additional feature engineering, and improving the model through hyperparameter tuning.
